The best choice of collective implementation depends upon the number and kind of GPUs, and the network interconnect in the cluster.

    "To save your model using `model.save` or `tf.saved_model.save`, the destination for saving needs to be different for each worker. On the non-chief workers, you will need to save the model to a temporary directory, and on the chief, you will need to save to the provided model directory. The temporary directories on the worker need to be unique to prevent errors resulting from multiple workers trying to write to the same location. The model saved in all the directories are identical and typically only the model saved by the chief should be referenced for restoring or serving. You should have some cleanup logic that deletes the temporary directories created by the workers once your training has completed.\n",

On the other hand, letting chief and workers save to the same model directory will result in errors due to contention.\n",
    "\n",
    "With `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`, the program is run on every worker, and in order to know whether the current worker is chief, it takes advantage of the cluster resolver object that has attributes `task_type` and `task_id`. `task_type` tells you what the current job is (e.g. 'worker'), and `task_id` tells you the identifier of the worker. The worker with id 0 is designated as the chief worker.\n",
